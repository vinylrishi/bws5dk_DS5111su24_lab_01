- gitinore should contain *.txt  
- Makerfile is in the "books" directory :)

- Added a token.py file that contains three functions to clean, tokenize, and count the frequency of words from a given string
- Makefile also checks to make sure python3 and pip are installed (needed to use "sudo" for this because of ubuntu)
- Note: I am having an issue with the token.py file in in that the "logging" package I am trying to use seems to be overwritten by some custom "logging.py" file from anaconda. I am not sure what the repercussions of deleting this file are for other python works, so for now I will not change anything. I ran the token.py code in a jupyter notebook to test it with some sample strings and it works fine for all 3 functions.
